## Instructions

Implement Simulated Annealing. 
Use it to solve  traveling salesman.

Use dataset provided with this task. 

Given is symmetric matrix. Each row and each column correspond to a vertex of a graph. For example 1st row and 1st column represents the same vertex. Values in a matrix are weights of edges incident to corresponding vertices. For example: in file tsp_data.txt the weight on edge that is incident to 3rd and 4th vertex is 68.  

Print all searched solutions (path for tsp or characteristic vector for knapsack), best solution of a problem and best length/ total value.
